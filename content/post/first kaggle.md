Two weekends ago, I decided to break my inhibitions about Kaggle and Kagglers and decided to do a hackathon hosted by Wids-
https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2020/overview!


It was a great learning experience and I am so glad, I decided to partake in it! I tried a few strategies - nothing too crazy or fancy, but did not have a whole lot of time to exhaust all the other options out there. By the hour of submission I was 125 on the public leader board, but when the results came in I was at 58, at about the 7th percentile! Yeah!! Not too shabby for a first timer. 

I will be posting another blog out with more details on the exercise itself. Stay tuned!
